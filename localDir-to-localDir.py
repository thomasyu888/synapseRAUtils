'''
	What it does: 
		Takes files on local machine/server directory (source),  
		subsets the files by pattern-matching (ex. files with '.txt' extension)
		copies them on a destination directory

		Learned:  
		# from itertools import product # this is for nested for loops
		# more info on itertools: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#recipes
		# Generators are for loops/memory cach in general https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators
		# Python allows nested functions
